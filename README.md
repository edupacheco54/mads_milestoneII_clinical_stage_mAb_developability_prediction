# üß¨ Therapeutic mAb Developability Analysis

## Project Overview

This project is part of **Milestone II** in the **Master of Applied Data Science (MADS)** program at the **University of Michigan**.

Our goal is to analyze a dataset of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) across various stages of clinical development (Phase II, Phase III, and approved) to evaluate their **developability characteristics** using machine learning approaches.

The study is divided into two primary components:

1. **Supervised Learning**  
   Development of a regression-based model to predict the *‚ÄúSlope of Accelerated Stability‚Äù* ‚Äî a quantitative indicator of mAb developability ‚Äî using amino acid sequence-derived features from the variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL) chains.

2. **Unsupervised Learning**  
   Application of **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to explore how antibodies naturally cluster in feature space, identifying potential relationships between sequence composition and developability metrics.
